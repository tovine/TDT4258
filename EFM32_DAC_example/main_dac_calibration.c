 *   The offset calibration routine converts 0 in single-ended mode and measures
 *   it with the ADC. The calibration register is adjusted until the output
 *   equals 0. This is done for both DAC channels.
 *   The gain calibration routine converts the maximum value in single ended mode
 *   and measures the output with the ADC. The calibration register is adjusted
 *   until the output equals the reference voltage minus a few LSB's.
